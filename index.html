  <p> With the national supply chain shortage this year, it seems as though not even Christmas can escape its repurcussions. It is reported that Christmas tree numbers this year are decreasing, both in artificial trees and real trees. </p>
  <p> Is There A Christmas Tree Shortage This Holiday Season? </p>

  <p><a href=https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2017/Online_Resources/Census_of_Horticulture_Specialties/index.php style="color:blue">The 2019 Census of Horticultural Specialties </a> explains that the inventory of total projected Christmas trees produced in the United States in 2020 was 118 million. </p>

<p> <a href=https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/years-christmas-tree-shortage-real style="color:blue"> Gothamist reported</a> that extreme weather has contributed to the Christmas tree shortage this year. This past spring, a frost damage hit Quebec,Canada, which was a major source of trees sold in the Northeast. Afterwards, a heatwave also hit farms in the Pacific Northeast.  </p>

<p> With the growing supply chain shortage, it is possible that families will have to act fast if they would like to secure a real tree for their homes.

<p>Jami Warner, from the <a href=https://realchristmastrees.org style="color:green">National Christmas Tree Association</a>, said, "Christmas is not canceled, everyone will be able to find a Christmas tree."</p>

<p> Despite her reassurance, the numbers of trees have in fact been significantly lower this year than previous years; it will be seemingly less easy for families to pick and choose the tree that they want in terms of size and height. Some families might have to settle for a less exquisite tree this year. </p>
